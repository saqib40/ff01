# FF01

**Yo stupid, what's up?**

You finally reached here.

Post-reading that self-help book, and listening to that podcast you found on the last page—the one that claimed to change your life—you surely are on the right track. Of course it will change your life. How else does change happen?

You will get a girl soon (despite what your friends tell you). Your dad will be proud of you—despite and regardless of your behavior.

You will make money despite knowing skills close to none. You won't have to beg your friend anymore. *Unbelievable, I know.*

And as that self-help guru told you, the path to such a life starts with this extension from **Room FF01, SVN Hostel**. You have finally found it after your long & tiring odyssey.

Yes, it surely is the first step to achieve Buddha's enlightenment. No doubt about that.

*Tried, tested, and verified by the already enlightened ChatGPT and Ginny (the godmen from FF01, SVN, NHCE, writer of numerous self-help books).*
